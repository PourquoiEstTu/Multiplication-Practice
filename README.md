# Multiplication-Practice
This is a program which generates single digit multiplication questions.
I'd say that the program is good practice for children who are first starting to learn their multiplication tables.
The executable (.exe) file which launches the program is in the Multiplication Practice folder.
Launch it and get to practicing!
